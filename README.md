# wiki3

## wikipedia in web3

information is one of the most important quantities that exist

correct information can lead to improvement of a system
false information can hurt a system

the current best source of information is wikipedia, which lives in web2 (1)

the aim of this project is to bring wiki to web3

## how does it work?

the solution is entirely **on-chain**.

start with accredited accounts - e.g. only academics employed by official universities
these can vote on any published white paper, whether they believe it be closer to true or closer to false
or vote on specific versions of a wiki page e.g.

voters get coins as rewards (r >= 0) for voting, have a cost (c >= 0) associated with voting, and have a reputation from the community

later, other communities can get accredited (e.g. lawyers guild, etc.)
later, everyone can vote

## the solution

the frontend allows us to see what a certain community thinks about a certain white paper.

e.g.
"what do professional physisicists think about this paper?"
"what do professional scientists think about this paper?"
"what do people of my city think about this paper?"
"what do all people think about this paper?"

wiki3 provides a transparent source of information - what does who think about the veracity of some information


## freedom of belief based on best information

people can then judge themselves what they want to believe based on this data

## a better solution

e.g.
i claim that the vast majority of scientists (or more relevantly, biologists) believe that the famous paper of Darwin on evolution is more true than false.
but how can i prove this right now?
with wiki3, it would be easy

## the difficulty

the parameters could depend on 
r rewards = 
c costs
could depend on 
voting is motivitad via reward tokens and filtered via accreditation ("soulbound NFTs" on accounts)

## why

everybody would agree that having a transparent, "unbribeble" (2) source of info is vital for the continuation of a society that we would like to live in.

## Algorand

the quality of a system of this importance has to be the best. according to my deep knowledge of maths and computing, i believe that is clearly Algorand.

notes
(1) even though wikipedia is not perfect, there is no better source for a lot of information; so, it is the best
(2) hopefully difficult to bribe large network => let accounts put up awards for specific white papers, like a mining reward.
