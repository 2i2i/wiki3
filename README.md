# wiki3

## wikipedia in web3

information is one of the most important quantities that exist

correct information can lead to the improvement of a system  
false information can hurt a system

the current best source of information is wikipedia, which lives in web2 (1)

the aim of this project is to bring wikipedia to web3

## how does it work?

the solution is entirely **on-chain**.

start with accredited accounts - e.g. only academics employed by official universities.
 these can vote on any published white paper, whether they believe it be closer to true or closer to false
or vote on specific versions of a wiki page e.g. or any other statement.

voters get coins as rewards (r >= 0) for voting, have a cost (c >= 0) associated with voting, and have a reputation from the community

later, other communities can get accredited (e.g. lawyers guild, etc.)  
later, everyone can vote

## the solution

the frontend allows us to see what a certain community thinks about a certain white paper.

e.g.
"what do professional physisicists think about this paper?"
"what do professional scientists think about this paper?"
"what do people of my city think about this paper?"
"what do all people think about this paper?"

wiki3 provides a transparent source of information - what does who think about the veracity of some information


## freedom of belief based on best information

people can then judge themselves what they want to believe based on this data

## a better solution

e.g.
i claim that the vast majority of scientists (or more relevantly, biologists) believe that the famous paper of Darwin on evolution is more true than false.
but how can i prove this right now?
with wiki3, it would be easy

## the difficulty

the parameters could depend on rep(utation)
r(rep) rewards  
c(rep) costs // though maybe this better be constant c==c(rep)  

the project would consist of researching and optimising for the best (r,c)  


## why

everybody would agree that having a transparent, "unbribeble" (2) source of info is vital for the continuation of a society that we would like to live in.

## safety

each university would carry the burden of proof of id, i.e. we give university issued emails a frozen NFT. that is their id. can be resend and NFT is connected to their email.

the rest has perfect security. everyone will get exactly the coins they should, etc.

## notes  
(1) even though wikipedia is not perfect, there is no better source for a lot of information; so, it is the best  
(2) hopefully difficult to bribe large network => let accounts put up awards for specific white papers, like a mining reward.
